# HMC5883L
A library to communicate with the HMC5883L I2C compass. It addresses shortcomings in other libraries. 
It includes a function to perform interactive calibrations over serial and asynchronous operation. 
I wrote this as a part of another project I was working on, and as such it's not super well documented.
